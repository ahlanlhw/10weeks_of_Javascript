Week 1's project will be creating a "Kanban Board" which we will be using throughout the rest of the weeks.

Functions should include
> drag and droppable
> select and be able to add different projects 
> state of completion
> data should be stored away using mongoDB community server

Aim here is to improve coding capabilities for front-end and backend.
